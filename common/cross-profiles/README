CROSS PROFILES
==============

This directory contains cross profiles to allow cross compilation for the specified target.
A cross profile file must provide the following variables:

	- DULGE_TARGET_MACHINE	(as returned by uname -m + optional -musl suffix)
	- DULGE_CROSS_TRIPLET	(the cross compiler triplet)
	- DULGE_CROSS_CFLAGS	(C compiler flags for the cross compiler)
	- DULGE_CROSS_CXXFLAGS	(C++ compiler flags for the cross compiler)
	- DULGE_CROSS_FFLAGS	(Fortran compiler flags for the cross compiler)
	- DULGE_CROSS_CPPFLAGS	(Preprocessor flags for the cross compiler)
	- DULGE_CROSS_LDFLAGS	(Linker flags for the cross compiler)
	- DULGE_CROSS_RUST_TARGET (the rust triplet for the rust cross compiler)
	- DULGE_CROSS_RUSTFLAGS (rust compiler flags for the cross compiler)
	- DULGE_CROSS_ZIG_TARGET	(the arch-os-abi target triplet for zig)
	- DULGE_CROSS_ZIG_CPU	(the cpu/feature set for zig)

A source package matching `cross-${DULGE_CROSS_TRIPLET}' must also exist.
